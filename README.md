# HorrorEngine

Project made by GiovanyH

This is going to be a Horror Game Engine for my horror game,
it will be made using C/C++, using almost zero libraries,
only the ones that are really necessary, like OpenGL, GLFW, etc.

For now, I'm going to use OpenGL and GLFW to make the window and
the rendering, but I'm going to make my own rendering system
later on.

I will also need some stuff that I used to use with glm
like vectors, matrices, etc. I'm going to make my own

All of that stuff is going to be inside of core/types/types.h,
the reason why types.h is inside of a folder called types is because
I plan on having more headers inside of the types folder

When I use GLFW for Input, I'm gonna be renaming them to my own
naming convention, so I can have a better understanding of what I'm using

naming convention example: gioVec2
