# HorrorEngine

Project made by GiovanyH

This is going to be a Horror Game Engine for my horror game,
it will be made using C/C++, using almost zero libraries,
only the ones that are really necessary, like Glad, GLFW, etc.

For now, I'm going to use Glad and GLFW to make the window and
the rendering.

I will also need some stuff that I used to use with glm
like vectors, matrices, etc. I'm going to make my own

All of that stuff is going to be inside of core/types/

When I use GLFW for Input, I'm gonna be renaming them to my own
naming convention, so I can have a better understanding of what I'm using

naming convention example: gioVec2
